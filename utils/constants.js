  {
    q: 'What does the Raid Guild onboarding journey look like and where am I at in it?',
    a: 'If your are filling out this form your journey has just begun. The next step is attending the upcoming season. Seasons are our cohort process for introducing the ways of the guild and testing your abilities. After you have completed the cohort and finished a Raid and RIP you are eligible to pledge membership.'
  },
  {
    q: 'How many hours should I devote to Raids?',
    a: 'Choose your own adventure. This is ultimately up to you. Time requirements are specific to the skills required for each Raid and RIP. Some Raiders are only available a few hours per week while others rarely leave the guild.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What are the expectation on the quality of my work?',
    a: 'We are a guild of professionals and expect the highest quality! We maintain high standards and strive for the best. However, we are also here to help you improve and expand your abilities.'

    q: 'What is the single source of truth in Discord so I can get oriented?',
    a: 'Prior to the season TOWN SQUARE is the most important category to follow. During the season COHORT will be relevant. After you become a member GUILD HQ contains the most up-to-date messages.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What stacks can I expect to encounter on Raid Guild projects?',
    a: 'We allow project teams to determine what tools they deem appropriate for the mission. However, HackMD, GitHub, Figma and React are pretty common and good to get familiar with.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What standards should I expect with regards to backends?',
    a: 'The majority of our contracts are written in Solidity. You should also be familiar with the Hardhat development environment and OpenZeppelin libraries.'
  },
  {
    q: 'Is TypeScript necessary and how strict should Prettier be?',
    a: 'While TypeScript is beneficial when deploying production code it is not required to ship an MVP. Raid parties should decide when to sacrifice speed for the benefits of TypeScript. Pretty code with strict rules helps hone our craft and encourage consistency within teams.'
  },

    q: 'Is there a preferred system for QA or bug tracking?',

  },
  {
    q: 'What is the consultation?',
    a: 'The consultation is an online call, usually through Discord or Google Meet, with one of our project managers and possibly some extra Raiders. The consultation itself lasts around 45 minutes and in it we will assess the challenges and discuss possible solution paths for your project.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What are the deliverables?',
    a:
      'In most cases, our clients know exactly what they need. In this case, the time of the consultation is used to understand requirements and gather information to create a project proposal. This usually includes a quote, list of work required, and a project timeline.' +
      '\nHowever, the huge variety of projects we review means we can’t promise a fixed deliverable to everyone that goes through this process. For some projects, the consultation serves as the initial discussion on the viability of an idea, with clear next steps defined. For others, consultation itself might become a round of troubleshooting or tech support.' +

    q: 'What happens after the consultation?',

  },
  {
    q: 'Why should I pay?',
    a:
      'We believe in fairly compensating everyone at the Guild for their time. Payment ensures that our project managers are incentivized to marshall our best Raiders quickly, so you get the best consultation possible.' +
      '\nYou may submit this form without paying, but we can’t guarantee that you will receive a response. Submissions without payment usually are non-profit, open source, or otherwise directly for the good of the Ethereum community and ecosystem.'

    q: 'Can I get a refund?',
    a:
      'If raiders determine that your project is not a good fit for the Guild, or that there are no Raiders with the right skillset to help you, a cleric will contact you letting you know that we will not proceed with the consultation and will refund the fee.' +
      '\nNo refunds will be given once a consultation has been completed. The fee compensates our members for the time dedicated to providing recommendations for your project.'
