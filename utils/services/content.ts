  description: `In a world where attention is a *commodity,* content creation matters.

  A good story is the best way to "sell" your product. People identify with strong brands. Your project's story is what makes it feel human.
  
  Your product might work so well that it's life-changing. If nobody hears your brand's story, then it doesn't matter. Your community will never grow to its full potential.
  
  Your users want to hear your project's newest updates. A good piece of content updates your community on what you've been working on.
  
  If all people hear from you is silence, they'll assume that your project is stagnant. Your community will be confused.`,
