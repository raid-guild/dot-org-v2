  Next time you're using your favorite app, think about its ease of use. If you're confused about how the app works, you probably wouldn't call it your favorite.
  
  Your app can be engineered to perfection, but if the UX sucks, your would-be users will leave. 
  
  Even worse, they'll also tell their friends about your app's poor UX
  
  Small details like easy navigation and tracking tools make a huge difference. If your app is easy to use, people will feel comfortable using it.`,
