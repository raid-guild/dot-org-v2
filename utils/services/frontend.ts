  description: `If your frontend has vulnerabilities, your users can lose money.

  Form validations, smart contract connections, gas estimates, conversions to Solidity "Big Number." These critical details might cause "leaks" in your app. 
  
  These "leaks" will create a headache for your team. Funds might disappear, and people will not be happy.
  
  Everybody but the most sophisticated crypto users need a frontend. Your smart contracts can work perfectly, but if your frontend has bugs, funds can get lost forever.
  
  For example, if your frontend has an input where users enter an amount of Ether, you need to convert it to a "BigNumber." Failure to do this will cause unexpected results.
  
  Your users also want feedback when using your frontend. For example, when money is sent to your smart contract, people will panic if they don't get feedback that the transaction is processing.
  
  Modern frontend technology changes fast! New frameworks and libraries are always being created. Not using these tools correctly can lead to "bloating" and slow down your app. 
  
  Humans' attention spans are at an all time low. A split second in your apps performance will cause users to leave.`,
